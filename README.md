## About Marionette.Toolkit

Marionette.Toolkit is a collection of opinionated extensions for
[Marionette](http://marionettejs.com) Each element helps to reduce boilerplate
for complex large scale application problems.  This toolkit was
built from scripts open sourced from [RoundingWell.com](http://roundingwell.com).

## Documentation
  [App](./docs/app.md) - An extension of `Marionette.Application`. Its purpose is to provide an object with a `initialize`/`start`/`stop`/`destroy` lifecycle.

  [Component](./docs/component.md) - An extension of `Marionette.Object`. Provides a consistent interface for which to package state-view-logic.

  [Asnyc App start](./docs/async-app-start.md) - How to easily start apps asynchronously.

  [StateMixin](./docs/mixins/state.md) - JavaScript Object with a `Backbone.Model` for keeping state.  Used by both the App and Component but can be applied to any Marionette Class.

  [ChildAppsMixin](./docs/mixins/child-apps.md) - Functionality to add or remove child Apps to a parent App, start apps asynchronously, and connect the child App lifecycle with the parent App lifecycle.

  [EventListenersMixin](./docs/mixins/event-listeners.md) - Binds events to the `App` while running and removed (and only those) when the `App` is stopped.
